## Introduction

The Coffee House website is a modern web application built using **ReactJS** with the **Context API** for state management. For the backend, we have implemented a simple server using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, and we are utilizing **MongoDB** as the database.

**User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login via email, utilizing JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication.

**Responsive Design:** Enjoy a seamless user experience with both dark mode and light mode themes.

**Site Structure:** The application consists of three main sections:
- Shop: Where users can browse and purchase products.
- Blog: A space for articles and insights related to coffee culture.
- Caf√©: Information about our coffee offerings and more.

**Shopping Cart:** Users can easily add products to their cart and place orders, which are recorded in the database.

**Filtering Options:** Various filters are available in both the blog and shop sections to enhance user navigation.

**This version is deployed here: https://coffeehouse.liara.run/**

**In the next version, we plan to introduce a User Panel and an Admin Panel to improve user management and content administration.**
